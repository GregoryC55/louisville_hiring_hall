    <h2>News and Events</h2>
    <h3>Ongoing Mercentary Campaign postponed</h3>
    <p>2016 has decided to kick me around so far this year and the campaign has been delayed.  My apologies to everyone, but personal health, transportation and my general sanity pushed this back a bit.  But, these are delays not stoppages.  Stay tuned!</p>
    <h3>New Ongoing Mercenary Campaign begins January 2016!</h3>
    <p>We will be starting our new campaign in the beginning of the new year.  For full details, please click <a href="../pdf/Ongoing_Mercenary_Campaign.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Fall 2015 Championship Ends! - December 2015</h3>
    <p>After two and a half months we have a new Louisville Champion.  Thank you to all the participating players and we will update everyone once the new plaque has been installed declaring our champion.</p>
    <h3>Fall 2015 Championship Begins! - October 2015</h3>
    <p>So who is the best MechWarrior in the Louisville?  Let's find out!</p>
    <p>Players will construct a unit of up to 6 machines with 10,000 BV points based upon the faction lists from Field Manual:3085.  Opponents will be assigned by myself.  The player with the most wins by the end of the tourny will have their name put on a plaque and hung in our local store to declare their glory!</p>
