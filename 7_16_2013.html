      <h2>Raid on Thraxa - Warehouse 14</h2>
      <p>Opponents: (Farmer as Magistracy of Canopus - Defender) vs. (CungrVanck as Marian Hegemony - Attacker)</p>
      <p>Forces: Magistracy - 2 x Wasps, 2 x Locust 1V, 2 x Locust 1M, Phoenix Hawk, Valkyrie</p>
      <p>Forces: Hegemony - Wasp, Stinger, Spider, Centurion, Panther</p>
      <p>Ruleset: Total Warfare</p>
      <p>Scenario: Destroy the opposing force</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Canopian forces started aggressively with three Locusts and the Valkyrie moving in amongst the Marian forces to get behind them.  As they won the first few rounds of initiative, they quickly succeeded with little damage to themselves.  The three Marian Mechs, Centurion, Panther, & Spider, were outnumbered and out maneuvered consistently.  Both the Centurion and Panther began losing back armor at a high rate.  Several internal hits were scored, but no criticals were achieved.  Marian forces were having a hard time connecting with any shots.</p>
      <p>The Marian Stinger and Wasp were successful in gaining the attention of the Canopian Wasps, Phoenix Hawk and one Locust which kept them out of the main fight.  After two rounds, the Defender realized his error and tried to redeploy his forces, but the Marian Wasp and Stinger made enough of a nuisance of themselves that they couldn't completely break away.  Though the Locust joined its compatriots in the main engagement</p>
      <p>The break in the battle came when one Canopian Locust failed a piloting roll in two consecutive rounds.  At the same time, Marian forces gained the initiative and were able to put down a Locust 1M and the Valkyrie with combined fire from the Centurion and Panther, luck of the dice, and a failed DFA from the Valkyrie.</p>
    <p>Shortly thereafter, the Marian Wasp was able to break away and join the main battle which put the Marians in a position of superior numbers and firepower.  The Canopians attempted to regroup, but the two remaining Locusts were dispatched with no kills to their credit.</p>
    <p>When the Marian forces reformed and prepared to hit the remaining Canopian forces, the defenders withdrew to avoid the inevitable.</p>
    <p>Result: Marian Hegemony Victory with no loss of Mechs, but a heck of a lot of armor removed.  Canopian forces lost five mechs (all four Locusts and the Valkyrie) and three withdrew with little damage. </p>
